# Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) Models

Welcome to the **TEA models repository!** This project contains tools for performing **dynamic Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA)** with integrated **uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo simulation**. These models enable comprehensive economic evaluation of projects by calculating key financial metrics and estimating worst-case profitability under uncertain parameters.


## Overview
This repository includes:

- **Dynamic TEA model implementation:**  
  Calculates economic metrics such as **Net Present Value (NPV)**, **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**, **Payback Period**, and **cash flow projections** dynamically over the project lifetime.

- **Uncertainty analysis via Monte Carlo simulation:**  
  Quantifies the impact of input parameter uncertainty on project profitability, providing **risk-aware insights** including worst-case scenarios.

- **Adaptability:**  
  Models can be customized and adapted for various industries and project cases by updating input parameters and assumptions.

- **Supporting files:**  
  Includes Excel and other formats for data input and graphical analysis outputs.

## Key Features

- Calculation of essential **economic indicators** to support project investment decisions  
- Dynamic modeling of project **cash flows, capital, and operational expenditures**  
- **Monte Carlo based sensitivity and risk analysis** to account for uncertainties in cost, price, yield, and other factors  
- **User-friendly interface** with Excel and optional integration with other data analysis tools

## How This Can Be Useful

- **Investors and analysts** can evaluate project viability with risk considerations  
- **Researchers** can adapt the framework for customized techno-economic studies in emerging technologies  
- **Decision-makers** gain transparency on potential financial risks and can plan mitigation strategies accordingly

## Getting Started

1. Download the provided Excel file `TEA Tool_Basque.xlsx` for the main model interface.  
2. Review the input assumptions and update them as needed to match your project scenario.  
3. Run the Monte Carlo simulation module to generate probabilistic profitability results.  
4. Use the graphical outputs to interpret the economic viability and risk profile.  
5. Explore the additional files for visualization (`TEA_ExcelGraphs.opju`) and process flow (`flowchart.drawio.png`).
